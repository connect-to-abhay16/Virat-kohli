          Born in Delhi, India, on November 5, 1988, to Prem Kohli, a criminal
          lawyer, and Saroj Kohli, a homemaker, Kohli grew up in a middle-class
          Punjabi family. He began formal cricket training at the West Delhi
          Cricket Academy at age nine. A pivotal moment in his youth was his
          father's death in 2006, an event that fueled his determination to
          pursue cricket with increased seriousness.
